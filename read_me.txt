README for G43
--------------
Our project relies mainly on sklearn, PyTorch, and .
Our code submission contains the following files:
we could not include the enviornment because it was too big , because the data is generated inside it.
This is my GitHub account https://github.com/aminebechrifa/COMP432 , where you can find the trained models . You can also train them directly in the code.
./code.py <-- The code is in different cells. Each cell considering a part(Data generation, utils, training)
* GPU is not required.
* Training takes ~6 hours.
* The report notebook saves files to an "out" directory.
For preprocessing and training we relied on the assignment and tutorials
